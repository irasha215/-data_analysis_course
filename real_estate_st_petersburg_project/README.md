This dataset is from Yandex Praktikum data-analyst course I was taking in 2021/2021.

Data from Yandex.realty about real estate market of Leningrad Oblast. Due to project I've been:
 - cleaning data: finding and replacing missing values, changing the types of data, finding duplicated data, doing lemmatization.
 - making boxplots to find outliers
 - finding correlation between price of the flat and different factors

Using:
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

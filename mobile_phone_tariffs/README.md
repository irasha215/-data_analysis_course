This dataset is from Yandex Praktikum data-analyst course I was taking in 2021/2021.

Description of the project:
  There're two different tariff plans and we need to find out which tariff gives more money.

Due to the project I've been:
 - making pivot tables with user's information
 - testing statistical hypothesis
 - making and analyzing plots
 - finding the most profitable tariff

Using:
 - pandas
 - numpy
 - seaborn
 - matplotlib
 - stats

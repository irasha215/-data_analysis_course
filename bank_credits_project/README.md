This dataset is from Yandex Praktikum data-analyst course I was taking in 2021/2021.

Data from credit department of the bank. Due to this project I've been:
 - cleaning data: finding and replacing missing values, changing the types of data, finding duplicated data, doing lemmatization.
 - looking for factors that influence the repayment of the loan on time

Using:
 - pandas
 - seaborn
 - matplotlib
 - pymystem3
